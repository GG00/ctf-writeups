Welcome to Small Hole Sciences.

(Since all of their budget was spent on moon rocks, they were only able to afford an old-fashioned Vigenere Cipher.)
```

It's a vigenere cipher, so let's crack it using cryptanalysis.

[Here](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher/Cryptanalysis#Python)'s one sample code from Rosetta Code.

```shell
$ python2 crack_vigenere.py

Look's like that we're on the right track.

Using some help with [quicquic.net](http://quipqiup.com/index.php), we can unscramble the cryptogram.
